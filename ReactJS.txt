There are two ways to get started with ReactJS.

First way=>

install npm and node
//web pack used to minify and combine css and js file; plus image files
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server --save-dev
npm install react react-dom --save
//babel convert and build es6 code to es 2015 to support on browsers
npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev
npm install webpack-cli -D --save


Development Part
webpack.config.js => has dependencies and files from where browser will start rendering
HTML file => a template to with all required elements
JSX file => which component we want to display and how they behave

Second way=>
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
check package.json file
now you can run with npm start
